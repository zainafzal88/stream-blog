Today, we had a session with Andrei Gec with extensive industry experience and wealth of knowledge.

We started off by showing how we solve our existing problem to Andrei. However, as we had a good turnout and were recieving many questions from the viewers, we decided to make it a Q & A session. Questions recieved from the viewers were great. Andrei's answers were very insightful. We ended with an energetic challenge of doing 5 push ups each.

Looking forward to having another session with Andrei soon.
