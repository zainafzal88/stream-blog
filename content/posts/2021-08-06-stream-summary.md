title: Posting Board Name to Backend Completed + Discussion and Planning of Next Feature
date: 2021-08-06

Today the posting board name from the frontend to the backend was done by a friend's help as we weren't sure where we were going wrong in Fetch API. We tested it and also analysed what we missed in our code that he added and it worked. 

We found out that our friend made the function `postBoardName`, `async` and passed the `boardName` as a parameter. It was then called in another function which is called when the button `go` on the home page of the application is clicked.

We then updated our ticket in Jira and chose the next task which was getting a specific board from the DynamoDB. Then, we discussed and planned the approach we will take by drawing a diagram to visualize the flow of the functionality.
