Today, to resolve the ongoing `CORS` error me and my co-host Zain tried a couple of different things. <br>
As redoplying the app worked the last time we were getting the `CORS` configuration error we went ahead and gave it a go. <br>
Then we setup all the policies including the `Model, Status code & Headers` from scratch. <br>
Even though after doing this we werent able to make it work, we have high hopes for tomorrow.
