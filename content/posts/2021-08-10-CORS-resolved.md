As promised yesterday we had high hopes for today. Yesterday we were really close to resolving the `CORS` error. <br>
Today we went ahead and followed an official AWS tutorial online on Youtube which had helped us to resolve the current error previously. <br>
Link to that video : [Resolve CORS video]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGDiOkqtUWA&ab_channel=AmazonWebServices") <br>

As expected and promised even though we went 20 minutes over time the last time we redeployed our API worked with all it's current features working as well. <br>

Hope you enjoyed <br>
Thanks, <br>
