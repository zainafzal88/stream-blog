title: getBoardByName() Completed + Jira Updated
date: 2021-08-11

Today we implemented a function in the middleware to get a board by name from the backend.

We got that done pretty quickly (yes, we are becoming good now!). We manage to do it the quick way however, it can still be improved.

We also updated the Jira board.
