Today, we discussed how to move to forward with positing text for note however, discovered that our express application needs to have a design change.

As we changed express app to get board by name, this would mean changing the entire logic of all eight controllers to take in name of board as a primary key (note description in the case of notes) which we do not want to do.

We have come up with a few approaches however, will decide the best one tomorrow.
