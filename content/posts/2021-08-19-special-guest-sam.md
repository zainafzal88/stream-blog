Today we had a privilege to have Sam Nolan, who is the President of The Programming Club at RMIT as our special guest.

We interviewed him on his experiences in programming, his entrepreneurial journey so far and his love for diving into software architecture.

As we know that our express application design had to change and we already had few options in our minds, however, we thought it would be good to pick Sam's creative brain up by sharing our ideas and see what he thinks.

He brought us to another approach which he thought and explained why it would be better than all our approaches. Considering the efficiency and the performance perspective, we decided we would go with his approach. So thanks to him for shedding light on that.

We really admire his passion for good suggestions and opinions about architectures and look forward to having him again soon.
