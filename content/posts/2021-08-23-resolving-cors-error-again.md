Today, we spent the entire session trying to resolve CORS error. 

We applied the same solution which we applied previously solving it, however, this time it didn't work.

We watched the AWS video again for resolving it and made sure we didn't miss anything. Seemed like we didn't but still not working.

Then we ran out of time. So, we will be coming to that again tomorrow.
