title: "Resolving CORS Error Again 4"

Today worked on looking at the responses we got from the Stack Overflow post.

We found out we only got one response which asked her to have a look at the CloudWatch logs which we did however, didn't find any leads.

Then we deleted the SAM stack and redeployed again to Enable CORS from scratch and that didn't seemed to work either.

We watched an AWS video showing us how to resolve it, followed but that didn't work for us as well.

Really keen to find out in which step we went wrong. Journey of resolving CORS error continues
