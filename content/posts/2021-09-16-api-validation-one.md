Today we worked on applying validation on all getting, posting, updating and deleting board requests. 

We made the we didn't make any redundant code and tried our best to apply best practices while doing putting in validation.

When we started to test, we noticed, some validations were working as intended and some weren't.

Tomorrow we will debug the ones that weren't working and fix them.
