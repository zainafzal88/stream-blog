title: "Implemented Validation For Posting Notes"

Today we debugged the methods of the board validation that weren't working and got them working.

Then we converted all the validation functions to arrow functions and made sure all the board validation functions are working as intended in Postman before we move onto notes.

Once we were satisfied, then we moved onto validating the post request for notes.
