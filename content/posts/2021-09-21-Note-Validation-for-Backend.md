Today we accomplished a lot while our friend Torey Littlefeild joined us from Bali.
Torey talked us through his journey of self teaching most of Software Development and how he is in love with it now. After working 10 years in eCommerce this was not an easy switch for Torey.

We also managed to code most of the note validation functionality in the backend. Come back tomorrow to see how we test it.
