Today we worked on finishing the validations for creating and updating the board and we refined the existing code base to make sure that everything was clean and works fine. This was important to do as we have other developers in our team who should be able to understand the code. 

We discussed the next steps around the Code Build and Code Deploy on AWS as well.

Some exciting stuff coming your way soon.
