Today we continued to discuss our merge from the stable-backend to dev and from dev to master.

During these tasks, we had some ineteresting conversations reloving around the implementation of VPCs in the serverless architecture.

We discussed how the services inside the cloud interact with each other and when a VPC is needed.
