So, as mentioned in the previous post, we managed to fix the validation with the posting notes.

"Final Testing" is being considered as final "for now" as we realised that posting board need one or two more validation scenarios as below:

1. Board name must be a string
2. Board name must not be empty

It was decide that we will work on it in our spare time and move to the frontend in streaming times
