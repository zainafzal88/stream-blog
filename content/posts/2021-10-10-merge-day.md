Today was very productive as we merged all the branches into dev and then master for the backend and frontend.

Since we had a bit of time left, we also managed to figure out a way to hide the api url in `middleware.js` (which we also renamed to `still-frontend.js`). How we did that was below:

- Created a new file called `environment.js`.
- Kept our api endpoint in that file as an object.
- Imported `environment.js` before `still-frontend.js` in `home.html` page
- Set the object to the variable `url` in `still-frontend.js`
