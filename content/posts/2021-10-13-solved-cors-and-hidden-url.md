Today, we decided to delete SAM stack and deploy it again to check if CORS error goes and IT WORKED!! One thing learnt with respect to CORS is if we try to fiddle with it manually, it will cause more problems and we will go down the rabbit hole.

Then we tested with our URL works as an environment variable and it did. So, the URL isn't visible to the viewers on the stream and in the github repo.

Lastly, we start the task of making the Board Name appear in the `index.html` page just above the board.
