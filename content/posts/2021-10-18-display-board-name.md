Today, we had Thanesh again and it was good to see him keen on coming on, having fun, learning and contributing at the same time. Good bloke, he is. His plan is to come on the stream every second night regularly which is great.

We also managed to get the board name from the database and display that in the console. However, we are still trying to display it on the board page. That being said, it was a good small step forward.
