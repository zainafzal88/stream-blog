Today,it was our special milestone completed which was 100th streaming episode. It was definitley a sense of achievement and fullfilment to stream and come this far.

It was even special as we had a special guest Matthew Coles from Amazon Web Services (AWS) with us.

An amazing and humble person who we look upto and have respect for. He talked about this journey of getting started with him streaming, Devs In The Shed, gave us a photo tour of how his Shed was built and shared his passion as a dev and how he comes up with all the amazing ideas.

Definitely, was a pleasure having him.
