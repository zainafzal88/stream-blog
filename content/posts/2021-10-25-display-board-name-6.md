Today, after a few minutes discussion, we realised that we we were skipping steps by going into getting a board functioanlity instead of sticking to the creating a board functionality and end to end logic. So, we needed to back step a bit.

As we got the name displaying working with the hardcoded value, we are now trying to display it with a dynamic `boardId`.
