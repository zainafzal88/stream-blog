As we decided off stream that we will display the board name from the local storage. We did exactly that. Thankfully the board name is displaying on the `index.html`. We also changed the `CSS` for board name to be more presentable.

Then, we needed to save the text on the notes(created) to the database too. However, we decided that we will get the latest version of the code from the original repository first and then continue with the notes.

One of the team member has already got the latest code ready. We need to merge his branch to the `dev`. As the changes were many, we didn't want to rush the merge. So, we'll be doing it off stream.
