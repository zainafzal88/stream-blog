Today, Kartik was unable to join as he had his assignment due. So I and Thanesh continued.

We wanted to ensure that the latest code after the merge was working. After testing, we found out that all the functionality that was in `script.js` wasn't working in the board page. We had to import `script.js` in `index.html` then, it started to work. Hurray!!

We added an icon for `Save` and found out the variable that was being used to insert the text.
