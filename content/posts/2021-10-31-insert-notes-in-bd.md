Today, our task was to get the text from the notes and insert them in database.

We tracked the variable which was storing the text on the note and console.logged it to make sure it was that variable. Then, we tried to send the text to database using that variable however, we recieved `CORS` issue again. 

We will continue tomorrow with solve the `CORS` issue.
