title: "Insert All Notes in Database Pt.2"

As it was an Indian festival, Diwali, Thanesh had other commitments so, he couldn't make it and Kartik was busy with his assignements.

So, inserting multiple notes in the database with a click of a button was the task. I believe Kartik already did a bit of the functionality however, I think the code wasn't pushed to the repository.

So, I started with my version. To be continued tomorrow hopefully (if I don't have overtime tomorrow).
