Today, Kartik couldn't make it due to a coding interview, however, Torey Littlefield joined us on the show. In today's episode, we started building a Real Time Messaging app using React and Pusher. 

We built out the UI and started to work on the logic, but due to time constraints we were unable to have it fully functional. Regardless, it was fun having Torey on the show, as well as working on something else for a change.

Going forward, we plan to continue working on Scrumblr-Enhancement where we will be figuring out how to update notes.
