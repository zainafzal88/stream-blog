title: "Unique Board Names - Pt.4"

Today, we continued working on fetching `boardNames` from the backend and storing it as an array in the frontend. This array will be used to check whether user entered `boardNames` are unique or have already been used.

During the stream, we managed to retrieve and store the `boardNames`, however, we later realised that this was stored as a string rather an array of objects. Now, we need to figure out how to store this as an array, so that we can easily implement the checking logic.

We will continue to work on this in the upcoming streams.
