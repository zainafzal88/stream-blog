Today was the merge day so, we did the frontend and backend merge to make `dev` and `master` to the latest code.

Frontend merge was done off the stream however, backend merge was done on the stream.

toreylittlefield's PR was reviewed and one minor change was needed before accepting the PR. So, we asked him to do the changes and re-submit.

Then, we tested the functionality after merging. Apparently, there was an issue with inserting functionality. Most likely a merging issue. We will come back to it tomorrrow.
