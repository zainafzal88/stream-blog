Today, we did remaining part of the `getBoardByName`.

However, when testing, we cam across a syntax error that we were unable to location. To aid us to find the syntax error, we were suggested to use `ESLint` for VS Code. It sounded a learning curve as we have to learn how to set it up and configure to use it.

We tried several things to set it up and our viewers helped us too but it wasn't working. Pretty sure, we were donig something wrong. 

We will come back to it tomorrow.
