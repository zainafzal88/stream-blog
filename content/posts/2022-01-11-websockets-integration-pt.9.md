Today, I (Thanesh) came back to the stream after taking a break for Christmas/New Years.

Since it was my first day back, Zain and Torey walked me through what they've been working on for the last few weeks. Basically, they explained what Websocket APIs are and how they have been implementing this within the project.

After this, we looked into why we were receiving an empty second response; however, we didn't far into this due to time.

We will continue investigating this in the upcoming streams.
