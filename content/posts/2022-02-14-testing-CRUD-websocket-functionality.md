title: 'Testing CRUD Websocket Functionality'

Recently, Torey has been working on this project offline and making some big contributions to push the project forward.

In today's epsiode, we tested the Websocket functionality that he integrated with the exisiting CRUD functionality.

Basically, Zain and I got on the same board from our individual computers and worked through each of the CRUD operations.

Each of the operations worked seamlessly, however there were a few bugs we noticed. These were:

1. Same card being created on different boards.
2. Save prompt not appearing when notes were being saved.
3. Websocket connection is being timed out too early.

We added these issues to our Jira board, to be worked on as we progress towards the MVP.
