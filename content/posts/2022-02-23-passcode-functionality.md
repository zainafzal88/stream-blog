In today's stream, we began implementing passcode functionality. This means users would enter a 4-digit pin upon board creation.

We proceeded to implement it in the backend, which saves the passcode in plaintext in DynamoDB.

Next, we started working on hashing the passcodes in NodeJS. We're about halfway and plan to finish this up in the upcoming stream.
